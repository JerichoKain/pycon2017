    "# Building Stream Processing Applications\n",
    "Amit Ramesh & Qui Nguyen\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Stream Processing\n",
    "all about data processing\n",
    "- batch\n",
    "- stream\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch\n",
    "- finite chunk of data\n",
    "- operations defined over entire input\n",
    "\n",
    "Stream\n",
    "- unbound stream of events flowing in\n",
    "- events are processed over time\n",
    "\n",
    "why choose stream?\n",
    "- Lower latency\n",
    "- most data is unbound, and streaming is more flexible\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting an application together\n",
    "example\n",
    "- ad campaign metrics\n",
    " - have ads\n",
    " - count views and clicks from logs (flat json)\n",
    "\n",
    "Components of data operations\n",
    "- source\n",
    "- stream processing engine\n",
    "- data sink\n",
    "\n",
    "types of operations\n",
    "1) ingestion\n",
    " - data reader\n",
    "2) stateless transforms\n",
    " - ie, filter, projection (ignore some fields, like map)\n",
    "3) Stateful Transforms\n",
    " - care about a window of data, sliding or tumbling\n",
    " - ie, aggregation\n",
    "4) keyed stateful transforms\n",
    " - group events by key (shuffle) within each window\n",
    " - ie, sum_views_by_cid, join_by_cid (multiple streams?)\n",
    "5) publishing\n",
    " - writing out\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design principles and tradeoffs\n",
    "Horizontal scalability: basic idea\n",
    "- data can always be broken down and distributed\n",
    "- user growth or regular usage (more at day vs less at night)\n",
    "\n",
    "How?\n",
    "- operations are atomic, so partitioning\n",
    " - random partitions (multiple ingestors)\n",
    " - key partitions (sort by type)\n",
    " \n",
    "watch out for hotspots, data skew\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling failures\n",
    "\n",
    "idempotency\n",
    "- can be applied more than once and have the same effect\n",
    "- ie, mutations, or stateless\n",
    "- some writes can be idempotent, like unique keys.\n",
    "- increments might break it.\n",
    "\n",
    "consistency vs availability\n",
    "- c = every read sees a current view of the data\n",
    "- a = capacity to serve request\n",
